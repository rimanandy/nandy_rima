Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyse the heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the heart disease.

Poblem Statement:
Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid 19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyse this health and medical data for better future preparation.

Dataset Details:
Attribute Information:

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

Conclusion: 
Thus, from the analysis, it can be clearly said that the level of cholesterol, fasting blood sugar levels, ST Depression, Blood pressure positively influences heart disease.
Males are more prone to cholesterol, high blood pressure, ST depression than females and hence have a higher risk of heart disease.
Heart diseases also affect the middle aged group of 40-55 years more than the older and younger groups.
Heart Diseases can also be suffered by people who show no typical pain of angina, therefore non-anginal pain due to its non-detection remains a larger cause for heart diseases.
Finally,51% of the population suffers from heart diseases, therefore one should maintain proper heart healthcare to prevent heart diseases.
